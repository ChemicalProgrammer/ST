# Line speed profile and throughput

Results now show a **design-speed profile** for non-conveyor machines. Normal
speed comes from `nominalRatePerSecond × 60`; configured maximum speed comes
from `processData.equipment.maximumSpeedBpm`. Both are expressed as a percent
of the selected pacemaker's normal speed. The chart shows the available
over-speed profile, not a certified V-Graph: the engine processes at nominal
speed and does not yet command maximum recovery speed after a microstop.
An imported Sheet sets nominal speed from its maximum-speed column, so a new
import has zero demonstrated recovery reserve until operating speed is set
separately in Line setup. An absent or lower-than-normal maximum is not
interpreted as valid capacity.

The line throughput KPI counts **only units exiting the final equipment**:
`outputCount / durationSeconds × 60`. This measures the complete simulated
run, including failures, starving, blocking and start-up. The selected
`unitOfFlow` is the unit of every stage; imported bottles-per-case is metadata,
not a bottle-to-case conversion. Never compare rates based on different flow
units without a conversion.

The machine table displays observed `equipment.outputCount / duration × 60`
and also separates it algebraically into intrinsic availability
`(duration − stoppedSeconds) / duration` and operating efficiency
`equipment.outputCount / (nominalRatePerSecond × availableSeconds)`.
Operating efficiency includes lost output due to starving, blocking, ramping
and other line interactions. This definition differs from the engine's
existing equipment `performance` metric, which divides by `runningSeconds`;
the two must not be silently substituted. The line outlet rate can differ
from individual machine rates during a finite run as material remains in the
buffers.

## Engineering evidence still missing

The supplied design reference describes backup reserve as the discharged and
in-transit containers divided by **free accumulation fraction** (`1 − P`) in
the accumulating zone. Existing `ConveyorEngineering` calculates its overflow
from effective product pitch (`D / P`) and already includes discharge runout,
reject/coding length, delay and containers discharged at stop. The two
formulations do not yet have proven equivalent definitions of `P`: the reference
distinguishes the discharge, coding and accumulating sections, while the
current engine derives one population from the upstream output and conveyor
speed. A geometry-audit PASS is therefore not proof that the separate reference
calculation was verified. Reconcile section-specific speeds/populations and
sensor positions with the full design worksheet before replacing the existing
physical zone model or certifying backup-sensor protection.
